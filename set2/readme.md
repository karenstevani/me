TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
The main knowledge that I gained this week would be the usage of loops. Specifically 'for' loops. Apart from that I also learned how to write operations according to the problems posed with the exercises, hence I increased my problem solving skills in coding through this week's set. I also learned about the debugging process; specifically the step by step execution that python does when you run the debugger. Sometimes, I still struggle with the conversion of string and integer throughout writing the algorithms, and completing the exercises still takes some time for me to finish. The loops_7 exercise was quite difficult too as it was very mathematical, hence finding the pattern for the if condition was challenging.

programming vocabularies:
calling = executing a certain function or method
.append() = function that adds data to a list
for loop = loop to ensure code runs again usually through a specific and stated amount of times
