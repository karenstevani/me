TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
During my set 3 activity, I developed my loop writing skills even better. This time around, I also learned how to utilise the 'while' loop, and applied it into operations for certain functions. Aside from that, I learned how to check and ensure a right format of data inputted by the users and showcasing a response error message if not. I learned how to utilize the try/except functions too (to perform risky lines of codes desired when running the program, whilst providing a safety net through the 'except' part if the performance fail, so the program still runs accordingly instead of crashing). The exercise 4 binary search is quite a struggle to do however, but I managed to understand the concept afterwards.
