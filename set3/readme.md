TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
During my set 3 activity, I developed my loop writing skills even better, mainly the usage of while loops. This time around, I also learned how to utilise the 'while' loop, and applied it into operations for certain functions. Aside from that, I learned how to check and ensure a right format of data inputted by the users and showcasing a response error message if not. I learned how to utilize the try/except functions too (to perform risky lines of codes desired when running the program, whilst providing a safety net through the 'except' part if the performance fail, so the program still runs accordingly instead of crashing). The exercise 4 binary search is quite a struggle to do however, but I managed to understand the concept afterwards.

programming notes:
while loop = loop to ensure code runs again usually through whether a certain argument or condition is met or not (dependant; i.e if a condition is met loop still runs or if it's still not met, loop still runs)
input = a function to ask user for their input
// = division symbol in python
random.randint() = function for python to pick a random integer between a specified range
binary search = search method in a list by repeating the process of finding the middle or half value and sequentially eliminating one part of it (first or second half depending on value's location) until value is found
