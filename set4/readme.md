TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
After completing set 4, I now understand more about how to complete certain exercises, mainly ones of calling certain data from different sources and manipulating them. I understand how to index data better too, whether in lists or dictionaries. As we did exercises to extract data from lots of different sources; pc file, json library and other urls, I am still unclear about which lines to write or functions to use to extract data from each certain specific resources.

programming notes:
json.loads() = function to load a json data
requests.get() = function used to send an HTTP GET request to a specified URL and retrieve the response from the server.
.status_code == 200 = to ensure that the request has succeeded and the server has returned the requested resource
.text = retrieve the content of the HTTP response in plain text format, typically used after the requests.get() function
