TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week, there is no class but we were told to review the basic pandas video. Through that, I learned about how to extract data from a downloaded csv folder or the website directly from python. I learned about a lot of functions such as .head() to show rows and .columns to show all the columns. As well as the value_counts() for categorical data and datalist_name.column_name to show results of one specific column. I learned how to make a lot of bars and line graphs too. It was quite a packed video to watch and learn at once. Hence towards the end when I was learning about slicing and folding, it got pretty difficult to comprehend.
