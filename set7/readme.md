TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I learned about how to extract data from a downloaded csv folder or the website directly from python. I learned about a lot of functions such as .head() to show rows and .columns to show all the columns. As well as the value_counts() for categorical data and datalist_name.column_name to show results of one specific column. We learned how to make bar and line graphs too. It was quite a packed week.
