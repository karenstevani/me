TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week we had the quiz for our class. I didn't really learn too much of new materials, just reviewed a lot of old content through doing each and all the exercises. Stuff that was unclear to me was the questions towards the end of the quiz. They were challenging.
